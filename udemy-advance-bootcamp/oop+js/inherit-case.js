// 1 - Create a constructor function for a Vehicle. Each vehicle should have a make, model and year property.

// 2 - Add a function to the Vehicle prototype called start which returns the string "VROOM!"

// 3 - Add a function to the Vehicle prototype called toString which returns the string "The make, model, and year are" concatenated with the make, model and year property

/* Examples 
    var vehicle = new Vehicle("Tractor", "John Deere", 1999)
    vehicle.toString() // 'The make, model, and year are Tractor John Deere 1999'
*/

// 4 - Create a constructor function for a Car. Each object created from the Car function should also have a make, model, and year and a property called numWheels which should be 4. The Car prototype should inherit all of the methods from the Vehicle prototype

// 5 - Create a constructor function for a Motorcycle. Each object created from the Motorcycle function should also have a make, model, and year and a property called numWheels which should be 2. The Motorcycle prototype should inherit all of the methods from the Vehicle prototype
